# Dynamic ionizer element to simulation ion back-bombardment in DC gun

Ion back bombardment is the main cause of GaAs photocathode lifetime limitation in high current DC gun. Earlier Ion back-bombardment is studied considering constant pressure along the beam pipe. However in reality pressure is not constant along the beam pipe, and it varies while the gun is in operation. We developed a new dynamic ionizer element that generates ions based on electrons energy, beampipe aperture and pressure value along the beamline.

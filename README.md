# new-dynamic-ionizer-element

Ion back bombardment is the main cause of cathode charge lifetime limitation in high current DC gun. Earlier Ion back-bombardment is studied considering constant pressure along the beam pipe. However in reality Pressure is not constant along the beam pipe, and it varies a lot while the gun is in operation. We developed a new dynamic ionizer element that generates ions based on electrons energy, beampipe aperture and pressure value on that position.
